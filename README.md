# Cinematics
Hello world! ðŸ˜€ 

This app is the implementation of the Cinematics app on App Design Apprentice.
The main goal of this app is to learn Jetpack Compose by implementing a design from figma file.

# Note:
  - This app focuses only on Jectpack Compose. So, some other MAD Skills may be ignored .
  - All Data that will be shown on the UI are stored in a static file for now (An API call to TMDB is planned in the future).
